Plays a round of zachtronics Mobius Front Solitaire game

Right now it isn't very smart about how it plays the game. (It does better than me though) Still it still wins more than not.
I use [clrmd](https://github.com/microsoft/clrmd) for accessing the C# objects and finding the cards values in memory.
