Plays a round of zachtronics Mobius Front Solitaire game

Right now it isn't smart about how it plays the game. (It does better than me though) Still it can successfully play and win.
I use [clrmd](https://github.com/microsoft/clrmd) for accessing the C# objects and finding the cards values in memory.
